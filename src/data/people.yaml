      Jim's first computer was a Commodore 64 he inherited from his Dad at age 11. Since he dropped out of a Microelectronic engineering degree when he was 20, he's been a taxi controller, Tarot reader, and for the last 14+ years, a developer. He's written code for Greenpeace, banks, and mobile messaging amongst others. Jim currently writes software for a 6th form college in Manchester.

      When he's not rolling his eyes at teachers, Jim also runs a couple of CoderDojo kids coding clubs, helps out at hackathons and spends a ludicrous amount of time in the cinema. Jim also helps run a local beer festival and can be heard uttering phrases such as "malt backbone" and "resinous freshness".

      Marie discovered coding during her Physics studies and immediately fell in love with it. She received a scholarship for Women and Minorities to attend a software development bootcamp in Manchester. After graduating, she taught Python to kids and teenagers during week-long camps and is now working as a Full Stack Developer in a UK-based startup.

      In her spare time, she volunteers on open source projects and teaches coding to adults. She enjoys doing sports a lot (particularly yoga), going for long walks in the countryside, reading and learning all kinds of new things. She has recently taken up boxing and gets hit in the face a lot, but still thinks it's fun!
